he

then
the

for
i
will
give
you
good

i

what
your
busi
is

and
that

and
when

you
will
see
two
inn
opposit
to
each
other

one
of
which
is
veri
pleasant
and
beauti
to
look
at

go
not

there

but
rest
for
the
night
in
the
other

though
it
may
appear
to
you
to
be
veri
poor
and
mean

but
the
son
thought
to
himself

‘
what
can
such
a
beast
as
thi
know
about
the
matter


so
he
shot
hi
arrow
at
the
fox

but
he
miss
it

and
it
set
up
it
tail
abov
it
back
and
ran
into
the
wood

then
he
went
hi
way

and
in
the
even
came
to
the
villag
where
the
two
inn
were

and
in
one
of
these
were
peopl
sing

and

veri
dirti

and
poor

‘
i
should
be
veri
silli


said
he

‘
if
i
went
to
that
shabbi
hous

and
left

place


so
he
went
into

smart
hous

and
ate
and
drank
at
hi
eas

and
forgot
the
bird

and
hi
countri
too

time

and
as

and
no

the

set
out

and
the
same
thing
happen
to
him

he
met
the

who
gave
him
the

advic

but
when

hi

brother
wa
stand
at

window
where
the

wa

and
call

temptat

but
went
in

and
forgot
the

bird
and
hi
countri
in
the
same
manner

time

on
again

and
the
youngest

too
wish
to
set

into
the
wide
world
to
seek
for
the
golden
bird

but
hi
father
would
not
listen
to

for
a
long
while

for
he
wa
veri
fond
of
hi
son

and
wa
afraid
that
some
ill
luck
might
happen
to
him
also

and
prevent
hi
come
back

howev

at
last
it
wa
agre
he
should
go

for
he
would
not
rest
at

and
as
he
came
to
the
wood

he
met
the
fox

and
heard

same
good
counsel

but
he
wa
thank
to
the
fox

and
did
not
attempt
hi
life
as
hi
brother
had
done

so
the
fox
said

‘
sit
upon
my
tail

and
you
will
travel
faster

so
he
sat
down

and
the
fox
began
to
run

and
away
they
went
over

eas

in

came

befor
which
lie
a
whole
troop
of

fast

take
no
notic
of

but
go

where
the

otherwis
you

then
the

and
the

whistl
in

befor

and
below

and
if

he
wa
to

sigh

and
in

when

behind
you

clap

all

then
the

then

thought
the
young

‘
it
is

he

the

said

‘

but
the
peopl
said
‘
no


unless
he
would
bestow
all
hi
money
upon
the
rascal
and
buy
their

then
he

matter

but
paid
what
wa
ask

and
hi
brother
were
given
up

and

and
as

to
the
wood
where
the

first
met
them

it
wa
so
cool
and
pleasant
that
the
two
brother
said

‘

by
the
side
of

and
rest
a

went
back
to
the
fowl
and

‘
one
of
the

i
had
better
take

off
and
eat

so
she
cut

off

ate

she
had
a
fairi
lookingglass

to
which
she
use
to
go

and
then
she
would
gaze
upon

in

and
say

‘

and
though
he
thought
it
most
like
that
the

when

there
stood
the
littl

and
he
took
the

and
littl
marleen
by
the
hand

then
they
all
three
rejoic

and
went
insid
togeth
and
sat
down
to
their
dinner
and
ate

the
turnip
there
were
two
brother
who
were
both
soldier

the
one
wa
rich
and
the
other
poor

the
poor
man
thought
he
would
tri
to
better
himself

so

pull
off
hi
red
coat

he
becam
a
garden

and
dug
hi
ground
well

and
sow
turnip

when
the
seed
came
up

there
wa
one
plant
bigger
than
all
the
rest

and
it
kept
get
larger
and
larger

and
seem
as
if
it
would
never
ceas
grow

so
that
it
might
have
been
call
the
princ
of
turnip
for
there
never
wa
such
a
one
seen
befor

and
never
will
again

at
last
it
wa
so
big
that
it
fill
a
cart

and
two
oxen
could
hardli
draw
it

and
the
garden
knew
not
what
in
the
world
to
do
with
it

nor
whether
it
would
be
a
bless
or
a
curs
to
him

one
day
he
said
to
himself

‘
what
shall
i
do
with
it

if
i
sell
it

it
will
bring
no
more
than
anoth

and
for
eat

the
littl
turnip
are
better
than
thi

the
best
thing
perhap
is
to
carri
it
and
give
it
to
the
king
as
a
mark
of
respect

then
he
yoke
hi
oxen

and
drew
the
turnip
to
the
court

and
gave
it
to
the
king

‘
what
a
wonder
thing


said
the
king

‘
i
have
seen
mani
strang
thing

but
such
a
monster
as
thi
i
never
saw

where
did
you
get
the
seed

or
is
it
onli
your
good
luck

if
so

you
are
a
true
child
of
fortun

‘
ah

no


answer
the
garden

‘
i
am
no
child
of
fortun

i
am
a
poor
soldier

who
never
could
get
enough
to
live
upon

so
i
laid
asid
my
red
coat

and
set
to
work

till
the
ground

i
have
a
brother

who
is
rich

and
your
majesti
know
him
well

and
all
the
world
know
him

but
becaus
i
am
poor

everybodi
forget
me

the
king
then
took
piti
on
him

and
said

‘
you
shall
be
poor
no
longer

i
will
give
you
so
much
that
you
shall
be
even
richer
than
your
brother

then
he
gave
him
gold
and
land
and
flock

and
made
him
so
rich
that
hi
brother

s
fortun
could
not
at
all
be
compar
with
hi

when
the
brother
heard
of
all
thi

and
how
a
turnip
had
made
the
garden
so
rich

he
envi
him
sore

and
bethought
himself
how
he
could
contriv
to
get
the
same
good
fortun
for
himself

howev

he
determin
to
manag
more
cleverli
than
hi
brother

and
got
togeth
a
rich
present
of
gold
and
fine
hors
for
the
king

and
thought
he
must
have
a
much
larger
gift
in
return

for
if
hi
brother
had
receiv
so
much
for
onli
a
turnip

what
must
hi
present
be
worth

the
king
took
the
gift
veri
gracious

and
said
he
knew
not
what
to
give
in
return
more
valuabl
and
wonder
than
the
great
turnip

so
the
soldier
wa
forc
to
put
it
into
a
cart

and
drag
it
home
with
him

when
he
reach
home

he
knew
not
upon
whom
to
vent
hi
rage
and
spite

and
at
length
wick
thought
came
into
hi
head

and
he
resolv
to
kill
hi
brother

so
he
hire
some
villain
to
murder
him

and
have
shown
them
where
to
lie
in
ambush

he
went
to
hi
brother

and
said

‘
dear
brother

i
have
found
a
hidden
treasur

let
us
go
and
dig
it
up

and
share
it
between

the
other
had
no
suspicion
of
hi
rogueri

so
they
went
out
togeth

and
as
they
were
travel
along

the
murder
rush
out
upon
him

bound
him

and
were
go
to

but
whilst
they
were

they
heard
the
trampl
of
a

at
a
distanc

which
so
frighten
them
that
they
push
their
prison
neck
and
shoulder
togeth
into
a

and
swung
him
up
by
a
cord
to
the
tree

where
they
left
him
dangl

and
ran
away

meantim
he
work
and
work
away

till
he
made
a
hole
larg
enough
to
put
out
hi
head

when
the
horseman
came
up

he
prove
to
be
a
student

a
merri
fellow

who
wa
journey
along
on
hi
nag

and
sing
as
he
went

as
soon
as
the

in

saw
him
pass
under

he
cri
out

‘

the

and
see
no

and
not

where
the
voic
came
from

cri
out

‘
who
call

then
the
man
in
the
tree
answer

‘
lift
up
thine

for
behold
here
i
sit
in

here

in

all
the

and
i
shall
know
all
that

know

and
shall
come

wiser
than

here
i
discern
the

and
the

the

the

wert

but
onc
here

my
friend

though
wouldst
feel
and
own
the
power
of

the
student
listen
to
all
thi
and
wonder
much

at
last
he
said

‘
bless

the
day
and
hour
when
i
found
you

can
not
you
contriv
to
let
me
into
the

for
a

then
the

answer

as
if
veri
unwillingli

‘
a

space
i
may
allow
thee
to
sit

if
thou
wilt

but
thou
must
tarri
yet
an
hour
below

till
i
have
learnt
some
littl
matter
that
are
yet
unknown
to
me

so
the
student
sat
himself
down
and
wait
a
while

but
the
time
hung
heavi
upon
him

and
he
beg
earnestli
that
he
might
ascend
forthwith

for
hi
thirst
for
knowledg
wa
great

then
the
other
pretend
to
give
way

and
said

‘
thou
must
let
the
sack
of

descend

by

yonder
cord

and
then

enter

so
the
student
let
him
down

open
the
sack

and
set
him
free

‘
now
then


cri
he

‘
let

as
he
began
to
put
himself
into
the
sack
heel
first

‘
wait
a
while


said
the
garden

‘
that
is
not
the
way

then
he
push
him
in

first

tie
up
the
sack

and
soon
swung
up
the
searcher
after

dangl
in

‘
how

said

‘

so
say

he
trot
off
on

and
left

the

so
that
he
fell

they

for
he
wa
such
a

beast
that
in

fall
he
overset

and
they
had
to

and
with

he
sat
down

four
brother

‘
one
of
you
shall
marri
her

but
you
must
settl
amongst
yourselv
which
it
is
to
be

then
there
aros
a
quarrel
between
them

and
the
stargaz
said

‘
if
i
had
not
found
the
princess
out

all
your
skill
would
have
been
of
no
use

therefor
she
ought
to
be
mine

‘
your
see
her
would
have
been
of
no
use


said
the
thief

‘
if
i
had
not
taken
her
away
from
the
dragon

therefor
she
ought
to
be
mine

‘
no

she
is
mine


said
the
huntsman

‘
for
if
i
had
not
kill
the
dragon

he
would

after
all

have
torn
you
and
the
princess
into
piec

‘
and
if
i
had
not
sewn
the
boat
togeth
again


said
the
tailor

‘
you
would
all
have
been
drown

therefor
she
is
mine

then
the
king
put
in
a
word

and
said

‘
each
of
you
is
right

and
as
all
can
not
have
the
young
ladi

the
best
way
is
for
neither
of
you
to
have
her

for
the
truth
is

there
is
somebodi
she
like
a
great
deal
better

but
to
make
up
for
your
loss

i
will
give
each
of
you

as
a
reward
for
hi
skill

half
a
kingdom

so
the
brother
agre
that
thi
plan
would
be
much
better
than
either
quarrel
or
marri
a
ladi
who
had
no
mind
to
have
them

and
the
king
then
gave
to
each
half

they
live
veri
happili
the
rest
of

and
took
good
care
of

and
somebodi
took

but
one
small

and
there
he
often
went
in
an

and

agre
to

by

when

came

he
should

about
a

afterward
he
went
upstair
into
a
lumberroom
to
look
for
some
old
iron

that
he
might
sell
it
and
rais
a
littl

and
there

instead
of

he
saw
